This week in the stake pool landscape changes, WAV pools changed from 100% margin fee to 8%, and had some more restructuring.

Also, EVE pools associated with Exodus wallet all had margin fee changes from 3 to 4%. Keep an eye on Exodus.

K-Effective has flat lined. It is given by equations:

But don't quote me on that

> y=m*x+b
